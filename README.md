Hi DiUs

As per the comments on code test , I did not spend much time on this code test.
Just tried to give you a good idea of what I wanted to do.

this is JavaScript and intended to be run as node index.js with some input list
list is supposed to be a comma separated list of product skus as listed in price like:
"atv,ipd,atv,vga,ipd,ipd"

for more syntax and react.js skills please have a look at the rest of my git repo.
Regards, Iman
